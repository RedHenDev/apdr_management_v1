# How do we need to structure the data?
And, so that we can move between spreadsheets and this new system.

Possibly, a trajectory object could be expandable, revealing the ADPR cycle details.

# Function

We want to visualise an overview of each student's tailored trajectory.
A trajectory, in detail, will comprise of a number of APDR cycles, and where, crucially, we have clear visualisation of 'selection points' (Plan) that inform the subsequent 'provision' (Do). Before each selection point (Plan), we necessarily have an 'organised compilation of evidence' (Assess/Review): the first compilation will be a collation of views from different staff, medical assessments, diagnostic documents, as well as parent and student voice at the centre; subsequent compilations will include careful and quantitative review of the preceding programme of provision. Authenticity and relevance are the principles of quality control here: authenticity and revelance mean fruitfully informing specific programmes of provision (i.e. at the selection point of the current cycle).
Timeframes for each cycle can be flexible, but defaulted to the requirements of the student's individual trajectory type as well as the operational constraints of our institution's systems and capacity.  

A trajectory will have a type, defined by a goal selected from a list of possibilities: 1) Accelerating Math, 2) Accelerating Eng, 3) Accelerating Math & Eng, 4) Integration with mainstream, 5) Support & Monitoring of SEMH or other barriers to learning, 6) Temporary meeting of needs in preparation for Specialist Provision.
